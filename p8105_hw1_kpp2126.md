## Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

# Description

The penguins dataset contains 344 observations or individual penguin
species. There are 8 variables, these variables detail the penguins’
measurements, sex, year, species, and island. Upon closer examination,
the categorical variables islands, years, and species contain 3 islands
(Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen), 3 years (2007, 2008, and 2009), and 3
species (Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo), respectively. The mean flipper
length of penguins with available flipper length data is 201 mm.

## Problem 2

``` r
p2_df = 
  tibble(
    p2_sample = rnorm(10),
    p2_sample_gtr0 = p2_sample > 0,
    p2_sample_ch = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
    p2_sample_fct = factor(c("low","low","low","med","med","med","high","high","high","high"))
  )
```

``` r
p2_df %>%
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), mean))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   p2_sample
    ##       <dbl>
    ## 1   -0.0703

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, p2_sample))
```

    ## [1] -0.0702784

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, p2_sample_gtr0))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, p2_sample_ch))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, p2_sample_ch)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, p2_sample_fct))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, p2_sample_fct)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

I tried to take the mean for columns that contained numeric values and
as expected it only produced a mean for `p2_sample`. In addition to
tidyverse, I separately pulled the means for all columns and my results
were successful for `p2_sample`, again, and for `p2_sample_gtr0`, which
produces a result based on the values that are TRUE since I created a
logical vector for all values greater than 0, resulting in a binary of 0
and 1. For `p2_sample_ch` and `p2_sample_fct`, both resulted in warnings
that indicated they’re neither numeric nor logical, further stating an
NA.

``` r
p2_df %>%
  dplyr::mutate_at(c('p2_sample', 'p2_sample_gtr0', 'p2_sample_ch', 'p2_sample_fct'), as.numeric)
```

    ## Warning in mask$eval_all_mutate(quo): NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(p2_df, p2_sample))
as.numeric(pull(p2_df, p2_sample_gtr0))
as.numeric(pull(p2_df, p2_sample_ch))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(p2_df, p2_sample_fct))
```

I ran the conversion code first in tidyverse and separately using
`as.numeric` for each variable, including the double coded variable
`p2_sample` for consistency. The `p2_sample_gtr0` converted the logical
vectors to numeric values for 0 and 1, which can no longer be
interpreted with the logical argument for false and true values and
instead taken as literal 0 and 1 numeric values. The `p2_sample_ch` did
not convert since they are characters and resulted in a warning and NAs.
The `p2_sample_fct` converted the previously coded factor levels to 1
(high), 2 (low) and 3 (med). The numbers were assigned based on
alphabetical order.

This helps explains why the mean can’t be taken when it’s a character or
a factor, because they are not coded as real numbers or logical vectors
(denoting 0, false or 1, true).
